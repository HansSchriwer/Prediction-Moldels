# Model 1:
Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

pip install requests pandas scikit-learn xgboost

# Step 2: Data Collection
You will need to collect historical data on sports matches. Various APIs provide sports data, such as SportRadar, The Odds API, and others. For this example, we will assume you have access to an API that provides the necessary data.

# Step 3: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
We'll fetch data, prepare it, and create features for the model.

# Step 4: Model Training
We'll use an XGBoost model to predict match outcomes.

# Step 5: Model Evaluation
We'll evaluate the model and predict potential winning bets.
Here's a detailed example using Python:

import requests
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import xgboost as xgb

# Example function to fetch sports data (replace with actual API calls)
def fetch_sports_data():
    # Placeholder for actual data fetching logic
    # Example data structure:
    data = {
        'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03'],
        'HomeTeam': ['TeamA', 'TeamB', 'TeamC'],
        'AwayTeam': ['TeamD', 'TeamE', 'TeamF'],
        'HomeGoals': [2, 1, 3],
        'AwayGoals': [1, 2, 0],
        'HomeOdds': [1.8, 2.0, 1.5],
        'AwayOdds': [2.1, 1.9, 2.5],
        'DrawOdds': [3.2, 3.0, 3.4]
    }
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Fetch and prepare data
df = fetch_sports_data()

# Feature engineering
df['HomeWin'] = (df['HomeGoals'] > df['AwayGoals']).astype(int)
df['AwayWin'] = (df['AwayGoals'] > df['HomeGoals']).astype(int)
df['Draw'] = (df['HomeGoals'] == df['AwayGoals']).astype(int)

# Example features and target
features = ['HomeOdds', 'AwayOdds', 'DrawOdds']
X = df[features]
y = df[['HomeWin', 'AwayWin', 'Draw']]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the XGBoost model for each outcome
models = {}
for target in ['HomeWin', 'AwayWin', 'Draw']:
    model = xgb.XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train[target])
    models[target] = model

# Evaluate the models
for target, model in models.items():
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print(f"Model Evaluation for {target}:")
    print(classification_report(y_test[target], y_pred))
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test[target], y_pred)}\n")

# Function to predict and evaluate betting options for new matches
def evaluate_betting_options(new_matches):
    new_df = pd.DataFrame(new_matches)
    new_X = new_df[features]
    
    predictions = {}
    for target, model in models.items():
        predictions[target] = model.predict(new_X)
    
    new_df['Predicted_HomeWin'] = predictions['HomeWin']
    new_df['Predicted_AwayWin'] = predictions['AwayWin']
    new_df['Predicted_Draw'] = predictions['Draw']
    
    return new_df

# Example new matches to evaluate
new_matches = {
    'Date': ['2023-01-04', '2023-01-05'],
    'HomeTeam': ['TeamG', 'TeamH'],
    'AwayTeam': ['TeamI', 'TeamJ'],
    'HomeOdds': [1.7, 2.2],
    'AwayOdds': [2.4, 1.8],
    'DrawOdds': [3.1, 3.3]
}

# Evaluate betting options
evaluated_bets = evaluate_betting_options(new_matches)
print(evaluated_bets)

# Explanation
1.	Data Collection:
o	fetch_sports_data(): This function simulates fetching sports data. Replace it with actual API calls.
2.	Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:
o	We create binary target variables for home win, away win, and draw outcomes.
3.	Model Training:
o	We train an XGBoost classifier for each outcome (home win, away win, draw).
4.	Model Evaluation:
o	We evaluate the models using classification metrics.
5.	Predicting New Matches:
o	evaluate_betting_options(): This function predicts outcomes for new matches and evaluates betting options.

  # Comments
•	Advanced Features: Include more advanced features such as team form, player statistics, head-to-head records, and other relevant metrics.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning.
•	Data Sources: Ensure reliable and comprehensive data sources.
•	Ethical Considerations: Always gamble responsibly and be aware of the legal implications.
This example provides a foundation for evaluating betting options using advanced analytics. Further refinement and incorporation of more complex features can improve prediction accuracy.
