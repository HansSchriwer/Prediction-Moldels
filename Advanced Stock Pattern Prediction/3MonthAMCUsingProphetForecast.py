# For a 3-month stock price forecast, several other models can be considered. 

### 1. **Prophet**
Prophet is an open-source tool developed by Facebook for forecasting time series data. It is particularly good at handling seasonality and holidays, making it useful for stock market predictions.

### 2. **XGBoost**
XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used for time series forecasting by transforming the data into a supervised learning problem. It is known for its high performance and accuracy.

### 3. **ARIMA/SARIMA**
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) are traditional statistical models used for time series forecasting. They are effective for capturing linear relationships in the data.

### 4. **N-BEATS**
N-BEATS is a neural network-based model specifically designed for time series forecasting. It has shown state-of-the-art performance on many forecasting benchmarks.

### 5. **CatBoost**
CatBoost is another gradient boosting algorithm that handles categorical features effectively and can be used for time series forecasting.

### Implementation Example: Prophet

Prophet is straightforward to use and provides interpretable forecasts. Here's an example of how to implement it for stock price prediction:

#### Step 1: Install Prophet

pip install prophet

#### Step 2: Data Preparation and Forecasting

import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet
import pandas_datareader as web

# Load data
ticker = 'AMC'
start = '2018-01-01'
end = '2023-01-01'
data = web.DataReader(ticker, data_source='yahoo', start=start, end=end).reset_index()

# Prepare data for Prophet
data = data[['Date', 'Close']]
data.columns = ['ds', 'y']

# Initialize the model
model = Prophet(daily_seasonality=True)
model.fit(data)

# Make future dataframe
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=90)
forecast = model.predict(future)

# Plot the forecast
model.plot(forecast)
model.plot_components(forecast)

### Implementation Example: XGBoost

#### Step 1: Install XGBoost

pip install xgboost

#### Step 2: Data Preparation and Forecasting

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import pandas_datareader as web

# Load data
ticker = 'AMC'
start = '2018-01-01'
end = '2023-01-01'
data = web.DataReader(ticker, data_source='yahoo', start=start, end=end).reset_index()

# Feature engineering
data['day'] = data['Date'].dt.day
data['month'] = data['Date'].dt.month
data['year'] = data['Date'].dt.year
data['day_of_week'] = data['Date'].dt.dayofweek
data['day_of_year'] = data['Date'].dt.dayofyear

# Lag features
for i in range(1, 8):
    data[f'lag_{i}'] = data['Close'].shift(i)

data = data.dropna()

# Prepare data for modeling
X = data[['day', 'month', 'year', 'day_of_week', 'day_of_year'] + [f'lag_{i}' for i in range(1, 8)]]
y = data['Close']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Initialize the model
model = xgb.XGBRegressor(objective='reg:squarederror', n_estimators=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Plot the results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(data['Date'], data['Close'], label='Actual')
plt.plot(data['Date'].iloc[len(X_train):], y_pred, label='Predicted')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

### Choosing the Best Model

The choice of the best model depends on various factors, including:
- **Data Characteristics**: The nature of your data (e.g., linear vs. non-linear relationships, seasonality).
- **Complexity**: The complexity of the model and interpretability.
- **Performance**: The performance metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) on your validation set.

For a 3-month forecast, models like Prophet and ARIMA can be good starting points due to their simplicity and interpretability. For more complex and potentially more accurate models, TFT, N-BEATS, and XGBoost are excellent choices.

Choosing the best model for AMC stock prediction depends on several factors, including the complexity of the data, the length of the forecast horizon, and the specific requirements for interpretability and accuracy. Here are a few considerations for each model mentioned earlier:

### Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
**Pros:**
- Handles multivariate time series data effectively.
- Captures long-term dependencies and complex relationships.
- Provides interpretability regarding the importance of different features.
**Cons:**
- Requires significant computational resources.
- More complex to implement and tune compared to simpler models.

### LSTM
**Pros:**
- Well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies.
- Good for univariate and multivariate time series data.
**Cons:**
- Can be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.
- May struggle with very long-term dependencies compared to TFT.

### Prophet
**Pros:**
- Easy to implement and tune.
- Handles seasonality and holiday effects well.
- Provides interpretable results.
**Cons:**
- May not capture complex relationships as effectively as neural networks.
- Less flexible for multivariate time series data.

### XGBoost
**Pros:**
- High performance and accuracy.
- Handles non-linear relationships well.
- Flexible for various types of data.
**Cons:**
- Requires feature engineering for time series data.
- Less interpretability compared to Prophet or TFT.

### ARIMA/SARIMA
**Pros:**
- Good for linear relationships and capturing seasonality.
- Interpretable results.
**Cons:**
- May struggle with non-linear relationships and complex patterns.
- Requires stationary data and can be sensitive to parameter tuning.

### N-BEATS
**Pros:**
- State-of-the-art performance for time series forecasting.
- Captures both linear and non-linear patterns effectively.
**Cons:**
- Requires significant computational resources.
- More complex to implement compared to simpler models.

### Recommendation

Given the factors for AMC stock prediction, I recommend the **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** model for the following reasons:
- **Complex Relationships**: AMC's stock price is influenced by various factors, including market trends, company performance, industry dynamics, and external events. TFT can capture these complex relationships.
- **Multivariate Data**: TFT handles multivariate time series data effectively, allowing the incorporation of various features such as technical indicators, macroeconomic variables, and other relevant factors.
- **Long-Term Dependencies**: TFT's ability to capture long-term dependencies makes it suitable for a 3-month forecast horizon.
- **Interpretability**: TFT provides insights into the importance of different features, which can be valuable for understanding the factors driving AMC's stock price.
