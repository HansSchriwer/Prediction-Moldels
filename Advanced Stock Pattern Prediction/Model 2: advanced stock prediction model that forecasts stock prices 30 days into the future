# Model 2 – advanced stock predictor:
Let's dive into a more complex and detailed implementation of the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for stock prediction. 
Extended Implementation Steps
1. Data Preparation
To create a robust model, we'll include additional features such as moving averages, trading volume, and perhaps external factors like market sentiment scores derived from news articles. We'll preprocess these features properly for the model.
2. Feature Engineering
We'll calculate several technical indicators commonly used in the stock market analysis:
•	Moving Averages: Short-term (10 days) and long-term (50 days)
•	Relative Strength Index (RSI): To measure the speed and change of price movements
•	MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): To reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a stock's price
3. Model Training with Advanced Configuration
We'll configure the TFT with more sophisticated parameters and use a more detailed approach to training including early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Detailed Python Code

import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from pytorch_forecasting import TimeSeriesDataSet, TemporalFusionTransformer
from pytorch_forecasting.data import GroupNormalizer

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('your_stock_data.csv')
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])
data['time_idx'] = data['date'].dt.year * 365 + data['date'].dt.dayofyear
data['time_idx'] -= data['time_idx'].min()

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA10'] = data['close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['MA50'] = data['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Calculate RSI
delta = data['close'].diff()
gain = (delta.where(delta > 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
loss = (-delta.where(delta < 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
rs = gain / loss
data['RSI'] = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))

# Calculate MACD
exp1 = data['close'].ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()
exp2 = data['close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()
data['MACD'] = exp1 - exp2

# Drop rows with NaN values due to rolling/moving averages
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Normalize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
data[['volume', 'MA10', 'MA50', 'RSI', 'MACD']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['volume', 'MA10', 'MA50', 'RSI', 'MACD']])

# Define training dataset
max_encoder_length = 60
max_prediction_length = 30

training = TimeSeriesDataSet(
    data[lambda x: x.time_idx <= x.time_idx.max() - max_prediction_length],
    time_idx="time_idx",
    target="close",
    group_ids=["series"],
    min_encoder_length=max_encoder_length // 2,
    max_encoder_length=max_encoder_length,
    min_prediction_length=1,
    max_prediction_length=max_prediction_length,
    static_categoricals=["series"],
    time_varying_known_reals=["time_idx", 'volume', 'MA10', 'MA50', 'RSI', 'MACD'],
    time_varying_unknown_reals=["close"],
    target_normalizer=GroupNormalizer(groups=["series"], transformation="softplus")
)

# Create dataloaders
batch_size = 64
train_dataloader = training.to_dataloader(train=True, batch_size=batch_size, num_workers=8)

# Define and train the model
tft = TemporalFusionTransformer.from_dataset(
    training,
    learning_rate=0.01,
    hidden_size=64,
    attention_head_size=4,
    dropout=0.1,
    hidden_continuous_size=16,
    output_size=7,  # predicting 7 quantiles
    loss=QuantileLoss(),
    log_interval=10,
    reduce_on_plateau_patience=5,
)

trainer = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(tft, max_epochs=50)
trainer.fit(tft, train_dataloader=train_dataloader)
Enhancements in This Code:
•	More Features: Including technical indicators enriches the model inputs.
•	Normalization: Using StandardScaler to normalize some of the features which helps in training.
•	Group Normalizer: Normalizes the target variable based on groups which can be more effective for diverse datasets.
•	Quantile Loss: We use Quantile Loss for predictions which is very useful in risk-sensitive scenarios where we want to quantify the uncertainty in our predictions.
This detailed setup should give a better model performance by capturing more nuances in the data, and the advanced techniques should help in handling overfitting and making the model more generalized.
